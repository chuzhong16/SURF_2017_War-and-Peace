use of trifacta and excel

	combine different dataset.
	becareful about id when applying union transformation in trifata or copy and past in excel
	csv output by trifacta will be in quotes, thus is not acceptable by MATLAB
	saving the csv file again using excel will solve this
	Gephi need the first line of a csv file to be column name (field name), add the first row in notepad or in excel before using gephi
